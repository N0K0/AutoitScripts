NOTE: This Repo will be refactored into a more general purpose solution  for all your needs. 
It started as a system to automate playing BF4 commander, but i want to make so much more out of it.

Furthermore, i want to see if it's possible to implement some sort of smart learning module and make it so that it can starte learning how to play games on its own (or at least pick out commands that are fitting the current scenario).

Going to start on this in about a month or two (end of August) when i've properly started with my masters.
